# NER-Chatbot

Streamlit interface developed from scratch with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Named Entity Recogntion (NER), and Gen AI chatbot capabilities. 

The tool can upload multiple PDF, Word or Text files to perform OCR and NER using user-defined labels stored in an Excel or CSV file. The query model saves message history and utilizes Langchain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-32k LLM to provide the user an interactive chatbot interface for the contents of the file.
